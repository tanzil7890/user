                        <p><strong class="fw-bold">Abstract: </strong> Field-programmable gate array is an integrated circuit design to be configured by a costumer or a designer
after manufacturing. This paper outlines the transformation of events, development, reproduction, and land use of FPGA
(Xilinx Spartan-3E X3S500E) the use of other NSSP equivalent calculations (one source of very limited method with
loads of non-contradictory edges). Its operating time has a high O-m (min (n, Îµ)), and uses mechanical properties in the
O (m) application, a good place to guess. It has been used in standard bench extraction cases and its presentation is
comparable to the use of the fast-paced wide-ranging cases of Digital - O (m + n log n) calculations. In the case of
practical problems, a calculation of the required deflection is required in the application for clock cycles repeated 200-
300 times. The use of mechanical devices is completely unchanged, and the paper proposes the design of a second-year
chip, which, when made, will allow the gadget to produce mechanically and reproduce continuously. The general
flexibility of the chip combined with its capacity and flexibility makes it understandable in the broad integration of the
research center and field conditions.<br>
In addition, the basic calculation is the result of another global equity analysis, which will be called "delayed acceleration"
because it depends on the control and recording speed of the equally increasing signals in an organization. This global
perspective tends to address a wide range of issues that are far more serious than roadmap, including the NP-complete
subset aggregate and Hamiltonia road issues. A quick plan to address the first of these problems is developed as part of
this work and is proposed immediately in the discussion.</p>

                    <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper potray you about how we can enhance our farming techniques through latest technology and get
100% out of it. And this paper will show you how can monitor and secure our farming. India is a nation which is
having more population and it is imperative to take care of the food adequately to all the individuals. The primary
concern which is expected to satisfy this prerequisite is exceptional "farming" with enough water and minerals in the
dirt keeping up this is bit risky. So incorporating the agribusiness field with Technology will make sound. <br>Programmed
soil highlights and condition bringing and choice taking should be possible by utilizing sensors and actuators,
developing the seed and getting the yield isn't the solitary thing, we can give security to cultivate land just as to the
product (obtained yield).
And in this paper I am going to show some of the ways to work on problem.</p>

of Things we can provide a monitoring system during this pandemic. This is an interconnected network which along with
other technologies like cloud & Artificial Intelligence can do wonders.<br>
In this Paper I have discussed a kit which helps doctors to diagnose COVID-19.</p>
