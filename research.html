                        <p><strong class="fw-bold">Abstract: </strong> Nowadays, breast cancer is a common problem appearing in women. According to statistics, by the end of 2020, there were 7.8 million women alive, who were diagnosed with breast cancer in the past 5 years. Making it the world’s most prevalent cancer. Although, predicting diagnosis & prognosis in breast cancer are two clinical applications that have represented a test to the scientists. But the utilization of AI and data mining strategies has changed the entire course of breast malignancy Diagnosis and Prognosis. Breast Cancer Diagnosis recognizes harmless from dangerous breast lumps and Breast Cancer Prognosis predicts when Breast Cancer is probably going to repeat in patients that have had their malignancies existed. Accordingly, these two issues are primarily in the extent of the grouping issues. Most data mining strategies that are regularly utilized in this space are considered as order classification and applied expectation methods allocate patients to either a harmless gathering that is non-cancerous or a” malignant” group that is cancerous. Consequently the breast malignancy demonstrative issues are fundamentally in the extent of the generally examined grouping issues. In this review, amazing order calculations to be an Artificial Neural Network has been applied for breast cancer prediction. Experiment results show that the previously mentioned calculations have a promising outcome for this reason with the general expectation precision of 96%, individually. A model can be built for each stage reflecting effect due to patient characteristics.

                    <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Field-programmable gate array is an integrated circuit design to be configured by a costumer or a designer
                        after manufacturing. This paper outlines the transformation of events, development, reproduction, and land use of FPGA
                        (Xilinx Spartan-3E X3S500E) the use of other NSSP equivalent calculations (one source of very limited method with
                        loads of non-contradictory edges). Its operating time has a high O-m (min (n, ε)), and uses mechanical properties in the
                        O (m) application, a good place to guess. It has been used in standard bench extraction cases and its presentation is
                        comparable to the use of the fast-paced wide-ranging cases of Digital - O (m + n log n) calculations. In the case of
                        practical problems, a calculation of the required deflection is required in the application for clock cycles repeated 200-
                        300 times. The use of mechanical devices is completely unchanged, and the paper proposes the design of a second-year
                        chip, which, when made, will allow the gadget to produce mechanically and reproduce continuously. The general
                        flexibility of the chip combined with its capacity and flexibility makes it understandable in the broad integration of the
                        research center and field conditions.<br>
                        In addition, the basic calculation is the result of another global equity analysis, which will be called "delayed acceleration"
                        because it depends on the control and recording speed of the equally increasing signals in an organization. This global
                        perspective tends to address a wide range of issues that are far more serious than roadmap, including the NP-complete
                        subset aggregate and Hamiltonia road issues. A quick plan to address the first of these problems is developed as part of
                        this work and is proposed immediately in the discussion.</p>

                        <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper potray you about how we can enhance our farming techniques through latest technology and get
                            100% out of it. And this paper will show you how can monitor and secure our farming. India is a nation which is
                            having more population and it is imperative to take care of the food adequately to all the individuals. The primary
                            concern which is expected to satisfy this prerequisite is exceptional "farming" with enough water and minerals in the
                            dirt keeping up this is bit risky. So incorporating the agribusiness field with Technology will make sound. <br>Programmed
                            soil highlights and condition bringing and choice taking should be possible by utilizing sensors and actuators,
                            developing the seed and getting the yield isn't the solitary thing, we can give security to cultivate land just as to the
                            product (obtained yield).
                            And in this paper I am going to show some of the ways to work on problem.</p>
